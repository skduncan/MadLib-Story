One day, Sandra Krewsky lost her mind. 
Nobody now knows why, but it happened - and when it did, 
Sandra decided to look at every page on the Internet, insisting that she wouldn't eat, drink, sleep or 
even use the washroom until the job was done. Traps set in her house stalled worried family members, 
and by the time they trounced the alligator guarding her bedroom door - 
it managed to snap her neighbour's finger clean off before going down - 
Sandra was already lostâ€¦ though the look of despair carved in her waxen features, 
and the cat video running repeat on her flickering computer screen, 
told them everything they needed to know. She'd seen too much. 
She'd learned that the Internet played for keeps.
