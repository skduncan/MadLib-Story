Today, though, he was too busy - he had [Plural Object/Action] to finish, a [A gathering for something] to attend, 
[Something like gifts] to buy - and he just wanted out of the office. 
So he hit the master switch and [Action performed by Raj] as the computer screen went dark. 
And then, to his [feeling like surprise (horror, joy, etc.)], so, too, did the lights above. 
And the lights down the hall from his office. 
The street lamps dimmed and [Action like explosion], [Object] swerved out of control and smashed, 
people knelt, clutched their heads and [Action like screaming], the earth rose and fell, 
storms erupted to life and assaulted the heaving planet, and, in a moment of absolute destruction, 
the universe reached out its invisible [Limb/Item/Etc.] and squeezed, 
popping Earth in two and sucking both crumbling halves into a black hole so large that it would, 
in time, engulf existence itself. Life and death moaned, because one had lost all her [Object/People/etc.], and the other was overwhelmed with [Feeling or Action similar to demise].

All because Raj hadn't shut down his computer properly.
